            <p>Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) are a legal agreement between a service provider and its users, outlining the rules, responsibilities,
             and rights associated with using the service. Typically, T&Cs include an introduction that explains the agreement, followed by an 
             acceptance clause where users agree to the terms by accessing the service. It covers user responsibilities, such as prohibiting 
             illegal activities, and details intellectual property rights, specifying ownership of content like logos and trademarks. 
             The agreement often includes disclaimers that limit the provider's liability for issues like service downtime or third-party links,
              along with termination clauses for breaches of terms. A governing law section specifies which jurisdiction governs disputes, 
              while privacy clauses address how user data is managed, often linking to the company's privacy policy. T&Cs may also include a 
              dispute resolution process, sometimes mandating arbitration or mediation, and often outline the conditions for refunds and 
            cancellations. Regular updates to T&Cs may occur, and users are expected to accept these changes if they continue using the service.</p>
